## Ray tracing in one weekend

This is something that was always so mysterious to me. I decided to follow up the tutorial from the http://www.realtimerendering.com and create this.
The point of this exercise was not to create _beautiful_ code, but rather code that would simply do simple ray tracing stuff and display spheres on a plane.
